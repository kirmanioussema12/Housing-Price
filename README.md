California Housing Price Prediction using Gradient Descent
Project Overview
This project implements a predictive model to estimate housing prices in California based on various geographical and demographic features. The model utilizes Gradient Descent, an iterative optimization algorithm that minimizes the cost function to improve prediction accuracy.

Objectives
Develop a regression model to predict housing prices.
Implement data preprocessing techniques to prepare the dataset for training and testing.
Visualize the data and model performance through various plots and graphs.
Calculate evaluation metrics, including accuracy and recall, to assess model effectiveness.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains comprehensive information about California housing, including features such as:

Geographic location
Median income
Population density
Number of rooms and bedrooms
Age of the property
The dataset is available at California Housing Prices on Kaggle.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: This includes handling missing values, normalizing features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: The project employs Gradient Descent to train the model, iteratively optimizing the parameters for accurate price predictions.
Performance Visualization: Multiple visualizations, including scatter plots of predicted vs. actual prices, residuals plots, and feature importance graphs, are included to provide insights into model performance and feature relevance.
Model Evaluation: Accuracy and recall metrics are calculated to measure the model's prediction quality.
Technologies Used
Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Conclusion
This project serves as a practical example of applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems, specifically in the domain of real estate pricing. The results highlight the capabilities of Gradient Descent in training effective predictive models while also providing a platform for further enhancements and experimentation with advanced techniques.
